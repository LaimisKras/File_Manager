# Description

The goal of this work was to create a PHP file manager. Its capabilities:
the ability to see files and/or directories,
the ability to browse catalogs and see their contents,
the ability to create new directories,
ability to delete files,
the application is protected by an authentication mechanism, you need to log in to access the file manager, and you can log out,
possibility to upload JPEG, JPG and PNG files (upload),
possibility to download files (download).
I used BOOTSTRAP CSS and CSS styles for all the work of the File Manager App.
